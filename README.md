# Zainas-Sassy-Magic-Conch
A 'magic conch' I made for my friend as a funny project. Allows the user to ask a question and it generates a random answer. I also put in a list of commands the user can enter to do things like view a list of all possible responses, or enter new responses. 
Written in Python.
